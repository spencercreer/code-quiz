# code-quiz
Timed multiple choice JavaScript quiz.

This application presents the user with a timed multiple choice JavaScript quiz and stores the user's initials and score to local storage.

When the user clicks the Start Quiz button, a seventy-five second timer begins and a randomly selected password is displayed to the screen. The application moves through a shuffled array of questions so the quiz is different with each attempt. If the user selects the answer, then a new question is displayed on the screen. If the user selects an incorrect choice, then ten seconds are subtracted from the quiz time.

When the timer runs out, "Time's Up" is displayed to the screen and the user may input his initials. When the user clicks submit, his initials and score are stored to local storage and each attempt is displayed to the screen. The user may clear the scores list by clicking the "Clear Highscores" button.
